# About

This is a simple way to start to do webVR using [three.js](http://www.threejs.org), [WebVR boilerplate](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate) & Web Audio API with THREE.Audio & THREE.AudioListener to have 3D positional audio in the scene

It uses [THREE.MeshLine](https://github.com/spite/THREE.MeshLine) created by [@thespite](http://twitter.com/thespite)

# Workflow

- From art to code
  - Cinema4D
    3D Art created with Cinema4D / Exported on .fbx format

  - Blender
    Imported from Blender / Optimized/simplified / Use Three.js Blender Export to export on JSON format as a scene

  - Text editor (Atom)
    Load JSON file with THREE.ObjectLoader and load the assets into our scene

- From music to code

  - Audacity
    Compress mp3 audio

  - Text editor (Atom)
    Load mp3 file with THREE.Audio and added to an 3D Object into the scene ( uses THREE.AudioListener too )
